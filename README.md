# pi-trainer

Ever wanted to win a pi memorisation contest, display your knack for useless knowledge, or simply forgot your calculator during your physics exam?
Look no further, introducing: Pi-Trainer, an iOS app created that allows you to memorise your pi digits to 100!

Featuring a 'training screen', designed to display all the digits grouped in fives for easier memorisation, and a 'testing' screen: an animated, sound-enabled
keypad which resets everytime an incorrect digit is inputted.

Upon entering 100 digits, well... you'll just have to find out!
